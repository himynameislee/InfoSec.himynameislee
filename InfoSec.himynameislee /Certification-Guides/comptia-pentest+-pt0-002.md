## Overview

The [Pentest+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest#overview) exam was hard. Probably more difficult than it should've been, at least for me. When I started with Pentest+, I was just doing modules on TryHackMe. At the time, I really didn't have an interest in taking the exam. But as time went on and I progressed through the Pentest+ pathway, I decided I would go for the certification. Bonus points because it also renewed my Security+

After I finished the Pentest+ pathway on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/pentestplus), I moved over to Udemy and picked up [Jason Dion's](https://www.udemy.com/user/jason-dion/?kw=jason+dion\&src=sac) Pentest+ course, as well as the practice exams. Jason's course was awesome and extremely detailed.

My thoughts on the Pentest+ are "It's fine". It has good information, but it doesn't make you a pentester. What it does well is go through the entire pentesting process, and helps you understand what goes on before, during, and after an engagement.&#x20;

All in all, I don't regret doing this certification, but if it expired I wouldn't be mad. All certifications hold some sort of value and no certification is necessarily "bad". I just think there are better options people should spend their time studying for.

* Side note, I did the old version of this pathway. Since I completed it, a new version was released and is more aligned with what's actually on the current Pentest+ exam.
