Howdy,

My name is Lee and I am a Cyber Security professional. Below is a collection of notes I have taken over the years that I would like to share. Being able to take notes is important in this field because you simply cannot remember everything. This Github repo is just something I'm starting to build out. Overtime, I will add more and more from my Gitbook.
