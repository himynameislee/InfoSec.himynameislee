# Readme

## Welcome

This section is going to include resources I used for some of the certifications I have. I'll also go over some key areas of the exam (without leaking exam information) and the ways I studied.

I'd also like to mention, I am in no way affiliated with any links provided in this section. I get nothing from doing this, and I am happy with that. I just want to pass what made me successful onto others who need the help.
